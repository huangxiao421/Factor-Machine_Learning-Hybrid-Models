# Factor-Machine_Learning-Hybrid-Models
This repository contains Factor/Machine-Learning hybrid models, which combine component analysis with machine learning extensions.

The implemented model variations include:
- Principal component analysis
- Independent component analysis
- Sparse principal component analysis
- Boosting
- Elastic Net (Ridge regression & LASSO)

The models were part of my Bachelor Thesis, in which they were used to forecast Dutch national house pricing with macroeconomic variables.
